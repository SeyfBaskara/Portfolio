Later, I ventured into a startup project in agriculture solutions, where my primary responsibilities included business planning and relationship management. \n\nAround two years ago, I made a career shift and decided to pursue software development. I dedicated myself to honing my skills in both front-end and back-end development over the next year. My front-end proficiencies encompassed Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the associated ecosystem, including React, Redux, and SASS. In parallel, I attained comprehensive experience with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose in the back-end. \n\nI then completed an exhaustive three-month full-stack Javascript training program at the School of Applied Technology, </ Salt> company. The program covered web standards, the software industry, mob programming, the TDD approach, working agile methods, and several other languages and frameworks, including Typescript, Next.js, Contentful, SQL, GraphQL, Docker, AWS, and more. \n\nPost-training, I secured a one-year contract as a full-stack developer, contributing to a front-end project that utilized Next.js, Contentful, and several other third-party technologies. Additionally, I built various weekly projects as part of the post-graduate program.\n\nOverall, my diverse experiences have provided me with a unique perspective and skill set that I bring to my current role as a full-stack software developer."
